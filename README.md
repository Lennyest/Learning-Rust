# What is this?

This is a simple cheat sheet for the Rust Documentation that has been simplified a lot for easy referencing.

There are some missing pages now, but the rest will be added as I go through, this is mostly for my own learning.

##ðŸ¦€ Full credits to the original creators of the Rust documentation, Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols.
